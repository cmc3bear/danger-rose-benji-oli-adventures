### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

1. **OQE-GameLogger Bridge:** Working but limited scope
2. **Event Coverage:** Only 30% of critical interactions logged
3. **Real-time Analysis:** Limited to file-based exports
4. **Environmental Interactions:** No logging of sprite-surface interactions

---

## Part 2: Missing Logging Features (Priority Analysis)

### üî¥ HIGH Priority (Critical for Optimization)

#### 1. Sprite-Environment Interactions
**Status:** NOT LOGGED  
**Impact:** Cannot optimize surface friction, off-road penalties  
**Current Code Location:** `src/scenes/drive.py:720` - `is_off_road` calculated but not logged

**Evidence Gap:**
```python
# Lines 720-721 in Drive scene - calculated but not logged
is_off_road = (self.player_x < self.road_left_edge or self.player_x > self.road_right_edge)
# Missing: log_system_event("environment", "surface_change", {...})
```

#### 2. Traffic Spawning Events  
**Status:** NOT LOGGED  
**Impact:** Cannot analyze traffic density patterns, spawn timing  
**Current Code Location:** `src/scenes/drive.py:1097` - `_spawn_npc_car()` method

**Evidence Gap:**
```python
# Lines 970-975 - spawn logic exists but not logged
if (self.traffic_spawn_timer > spawn_interval and  
    len(self.npc_cars) < self.max_traffic_cars and
    random.random() < self.traffic_density):
        self._spawn_npc_car()  # No logging here
```

#### 3. Collision Differentiation  
**Status:** PARTIALLY LOGGED  
**Impact:** Cannot distinguish near-misses from actual collisions  
**Current Code Location:** `src/scenes/drive.py:1750-1780` - collision detection

**Evidence Gap:**
```python
# Current: Only logs actual collisions
# Missing: Near-miss detection (when collision_distance < threshold)
```

#### 4. Traffic AI Reactions  
**Status:** NOT LOGGED  
**Impact:** Cannot validate AI realism or player influence  
**Current Code Location:** `src/scenes/drive.py:1332` - AI behavior updates

### üü° MEDIUM Priority (Optimization Features)

#### 5. Road Tracking Accuracy
**Status:** NOT LOGGED  
**Details:** Lane position calculated (`player_x`, `road_left_edge`) but not logged

#### 6. Hazard Spawning Events
**Status:** NOT LOGGED  
**Details:** Construction zones spawn (`_spawn_construction_zone`) but not logged

#### 7. Sound Effect Triggers
**Status:** PARTIALLY LOGGED  
**Details:** Audio events logged but not trigger conditions

#### 8. Environmental State Changes
**Status:** NOT LOGGED  
**Details:** Road curves, surface noise calculated but not logged

#### Task 1.1: Sprite-Environment Logging
**File:** `src/scenes/drive.py`  
**Location:** Lines 720-730 (off-road detection)

```python
# Add after line 721
if hasattr(self, 'previous_surface_state'):
    if is_off_road != self.previous_surface_state:
        self._log_oqe_event("environment_interaction", {
            "surface_type": "grass" if is_off_road else "road",

        })
self.previous_surface_state = is_off_road
```

#### Task 1.2: Traffic Spawning Logging
**File:** `src/scenes/drive.py`  
**Location:** Lines 1097-1150 (`_spawn_npc_car` method)

```python
# Add at start of _spawn_npc_car method
spawn_data = {
    "spawn_reason": "density_timer",
    "traffic_density": self.traffic_density,
    "current_cars": len(self.npc_cars),
    "max_cars": self.max_traffic_cars,

    """Calculate current lane number (1-4) from player_x position"""
    # Implementation based on road_left_edge, road_right_edge
    
def _calculate_surface_penalty(self) -> float:
    """Calculate speed penalty for current surface"""
    # Implementation based on surface type
    
def _calculate_collision_distance(self, obj) -> float:
    """Calculate distance to collision with object"""  
    # Implementation for near-miss detection
```

### 2. Enhanced OQE Event Types

```python
# Add to _log_oqe_event method
SUPPORTED_EVENT_TYPES = [
    "environment_interaction",
    "traffic_spawned", 
    "traffic_despawned",
    "near_miss_detected",
    "collision_occurred",
    "ai_decision_made",
    "hazard_spawned",
    "sound_triggered"
]
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

```python
# Add periodic performance logging
if self.frame_count % 300 == 0:  # Every 5 seconds
    self._log_oqe_event("performance_sample", {
        "fps": current_fps,
        "memory_mb": psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024,
        "active_cars": len(self.npc_cars),
        "active_hazards": len(self.hazards)
    })
```
