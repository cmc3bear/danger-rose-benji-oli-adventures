## Problem Description
The highway lacked visual variety with only a simple sky gradient background. No scenery elements existed to create an immersive driving experience.

## Current State (From)
- Basic sky gradient only
- No scenery variation
- Monotonous visual experience
- No sense of location or journey

## Implemented State (To)
- Complete scenery asset system implemented
- Water sprites generated using DALL-E API
- All scenery folders populated with appropriate assets
- Foundation for dynamic scenic backgrounds ready

## Implementation Details

### Asset Generation
1. **Water Sprites (DALL-E Generated - Curated)**
   - Selected lake sprite for lake scenery sections
   - Selected river sprite for riverside highway sections
   
2. **Other Scenery (User Provided)**
   - Trees folder - Pine and deciduous trees
   - Mountains folder - Mountain backgrounds
   - Buildings folder - City skyline elements
   - Desert folder - Cacti and desert elements

### Technical Implementation
- Created sprite generation scripts using OpenAI API
- Established consistent pixel art style
- Set up proper directory structure
- Added attribution documentation

### API Integration
- Used OpenAI DALL-E 2 API for water sprite generation
- Prompts crafted to match Kenney.nl aesthetic
- Generated at appropriate resolutions for game use

## Results
✅ Complete scenery asset library created
✅ Water sprites match existing art style
✅ All folders populated with appropriate assets
✅ Ready for scenic background system implementation
✅ Proper attribution and documentation
