## üìù Notes for Developers

This mini-game combines typing education with a fun hacker theme that appeals to kids while teaching ethical computer use. The "HackerDad" character reinforces positive hacking (white hat) principles.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Make typing feel like an exciting hacking adventure
- Emphasize ethical hacking and cybersecurity awareness
- Use familiar hacker culture references appropriately
- Balance challenge with accessibility for young players
- Teach real commands and programming concepts

**Ethical Hacking Education:**
- Always frame hacking as problem-solving and security testing
- Include messages about responsible computer use
- Show consequences of malicious hacking (getting "traced")
- Reward ethical choices and learning

**Visual Implementation:**
- Laptop should be prominent but not obstruct table view
- CRT effects should be nostalgic but not strain eyes
- Matrix rain should be background element, not distracting
- Terminal text must be highly readable despite effects

**Integration with Existing Game:**
- Laptop fits naturally on living room table
- Maintains retro gaming aesthetic with cyberpunk twist
- Uses existing interaction system (E to interact)
- Follows established achievement and progression patterns
