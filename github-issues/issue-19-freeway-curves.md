# Issue #19: Gentle Freeway Curves

## GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Add realistic gentle highway curves  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Labels**: enhancement, road-system, realism  
**Milestone**: Phase 3.2 - Hazard System  

## Problem Description
The highway only had discrete sharp turns every 8-10 seconds, which didn't feel like a real freeway. Real highways have gentle, continuous curves.

## Current State (From)
- Only discrete turn events
- No gentle highway curves
- Unrealistic straight sections
- Abrupt turn transitions

## Fixed State (To)
- Gentle freeway curves using low-frequency sine waves
- Continuous subtle road curvature
- Combines with discrete turns for variety
- More realistic highway feel

## Implementation Details
### Technical Changes
- Added freeway curve calculation:
  ```python
  freeway_curve_freq = 0.03  # Very slow curves
  freeway_curve_amplitude = 0.25  # Gentle curves
  ```
- Base curve with variation wave
- Reduced influence during sharp turns (30%)
- Full influence on straight sections

### Visual Impact
- Highway now gently curves left and right
- Feels more like real freeway driving
- Maintains existing turn system for variety
- Smooth, natural road flow

## Results
✅ Gentle continuous curves implemented
✅ Combines well with turn system
✅ More realistic highway experience
✅ No performance impact
