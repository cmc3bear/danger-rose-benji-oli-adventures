## Refinement Issue #R2: Ultra-Precise Movement Controls ✅

### GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Further Tighten Car Movement for Ultra-Precision Control  
**Status**: CLOSED ✅  
**Labels**: refinement, controls, user-feedback  
**Milestone**: 3.1 Refinements  

### Current State (From)
- Base steering speed: 0.5 * dt (still felt loose)
- Turn influence: 0.08 (auto-assistance too strong)
- Steering response: 0.3 * dt (automatic movement too aggressive)
- Curve influence: 0.08 (road curves affecting car too much)
- Momentum influence: 0.08 (drift effects too prominent)

### Desired State (To)
- Base steering speed: 0.35 * dt (ultra-tight precision)
- Turn influence: 0.04 (minimal auto-assistance)
- Steering response: 0.15 * dt (subtle automatic movement)
- Curve influence: 0.04 (minimal road curve effect)
- Momentum influence: 0.04 (controlled drift)

### Implementation
- ✅ Reduced base_steering_speed from 0.5 to 0.35 for precision control
- ✅ Reduced turn_influence_strength from 0.08 to 0.04 for minimal auto-assistance
- ✅ Reduced steering_response_rate from 0.3 to 0.15 for subtle response
- ✅ Reduced curve_influence from 0.08 to 0.04 for minimal curve effects
- ✅ Reduced momentum_influence from 0.08 to 0.04 for controlled drift

### Results
- Car movement feels ultra-precise and controlled
- Player has full manual control with minimal auto-assistance
- Drift and momentum effects are present but not intrusive
- Responsive to user feedback for tighter controls

## Refinement Issue #R3: EV Rotation Tied to Movement ✅

### GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Tie EV Car Rotation Directly to Steering Input  
**Status**: CLOSED ✅  
**Labels**: refinement, vehicle-physics, visual-feedback  
**Milestone**: 3.1 Refinements  

### Current State (From)
- Car rotation only based on turn state (road turns)
- No immediate visual feedback for steering input
- Rotation felt disconnected from player actions

### Desired State (To)
- Car rotation directly tied to steering input (arrows/WASD)
- Immediate visual feedback when player steers
- Combined input rotation + road turn rotation
- Player input has priority over automatic rotation

### Implementation
- ✅ Added input_rotation calculation based on key presses
- ✅ Left/Right keys now provide 70% of max rotation immediately
- ✅ Road turn influence reduced to 30% of max rotation
- ✅ Combined rotations with input taking priority
- ✅ Increased rotation speed to 150°/sec for responsive feedback
- ✅ Clamped total rotation to ±18° maximum

### Results
- Car visually responds immediately to steering input
- Rotation feels tightly connected to player movement
- Road turns still influence rotation but don't overpower player input
- Enhanced visual feedback improves driving feel

## Refinement Issue #R4: Oncoming Traffic POV Fix ✅

### GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Fix Oncoming Lane Movement to Match Player POV  
**Status**: CLOSED ✅  
**Labels**: refinement, traffic-system, player-experience  
**Milestone**: 3.1 Refinements  

### Current State (From)
- Oncoming traffic appeared to move in reverse
- Movement didn't match player's point of view
- Visual orientation inconsistent with expected behavior

### Desired State (To)
- Oncoming traffic approaches naturally from ahead
- Movement matches player's driving perspective
- Cars appear to come toward player and pass by realistically
- Proper visual orientation for oncoming vehicles

### Implementation
- ✅ Fixed oncoming traffic movement calculation
- ✅ Oncoming cars now approach from ahead (positive y to negative y)
- ✅ Movement speed uses combined player + oncoming speed
- ✅ Visual orientation updated: oncoming cars show headlights (facing player)
- ✅ Natural passing behavior from player's perspective

### Results
- Oncoming traffic now moves naturally from player's POV
- Cars approach from ahead and pass by realistically
- Visual orientation matches expected driving experience
- Enhanced immersion and realism

## Refinement Issue #R5: Traffic Lane Direction Constraints ✅

### GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Restrict Traffic to Proper Directional Lanes with Lane Change Constraints  
**Status**: CLOSED ✅  
**Labels**: refinement, traffic-system, lane-discipline  
**Milestone**: 3.1 Refinements  

### Current State (From)
- Traffic cars spawning in incorrect lane positions
- Same-direction and oncoming traffic mixing lanes
- No lane direction constraints for traffic AI
- Cars not staying within proper directional boundaries

### Desired State (To)
- Same-direction traffic restricted to lanes 0-1 (left half of road)
- Oncoming traffic restricted to lanes 2-3 (right half of road)
- Lane changes only allowed within same direction
- Traffic cars stay within their directional road boundaries
- Proper lane discipline enforcement

### Implementation
- ✅ Updated spawn positioning to use directional lane separation
- ✅ Split road into two halves: left (same direction), right (oncoming)
- ✅ Modified lane change AI to respect directional constraints
- ✅ Enhanced traffic boundary enforcement for directional lanes
- ✅ Added lane drift correction to keep cars in proper lanes
- ✅ Updated lane change safety checks for directional boundaries

### Technical Details
**Road Layout:**
- Left half (0.2-0.5): Same-direction lanes 0,1
- Right half (0.5-0.8): Oncoming lanes 2,3
- Each direction gets 2 lanes with proper spacing

**Lane Change Rules:**
- Same-direction cars: Can only change between lanes 0 ↔ 1
- Oncoming cars: Can only change between lanes 2 ↔ 3
- No cross-direction lane changes allowed

**Boundary Enforcement:**
- Directional boundaries enforced with margins
- Lane drift correction guides cars to lane centers
- Lane changes cancelled if cars drift outside boundaries

### Results
- Traffic now respects proper directional lane discipline
- Same-direction and oncoming traffic stay in their respective halves
- Lane changes occur only within same direction of travel
- Realistic highway traffic behavior with proper lane separation
- Enhanced traffic system ready for collision detection
