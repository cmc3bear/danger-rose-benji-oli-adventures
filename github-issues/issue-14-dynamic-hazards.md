# Issue #14: Dynamic Hazards (Oil Slicks & Debris)

## GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Implement dynamic hazards for enhanced driving challenge  
**Status**: COMPLETED âœ…  
**Labels**: enhancement, phase-3.2, hazard-system, gameplay  
**Milestone**: Phase 3.2 - Hazard System  

## Problem Description
While static hazards (cones, barriers) provide predictable obstacles, the highway lacks dynamic hazards that create unexpected challenges and require quick reflexes.

## Current State (From)
- Only static hazards in construction zones
- Predictable hazard placement
- No environmental hazards that affect vehicle handling
- Limited variety in obstacle types

## Desired State (To)
- Oil slicks that cause loss of traction
- Road debris that damages vehicle
- Dynamic spawning based on traffic patterns
- Visual effects for hazard interactions
- Different physics effects for each hazard type

## Implementation Details

### Hazard Types
1. **Oil Slicks**
   - Size: 64x32 pixels (elongated)
   - Effect: Reduces steering control by 70%
   - Duration: 1.5 seconds of slippery effect
   - Visual: Dark glossy surface with rainbow sheen
   - Spawns: Behind trucks occasionally

2. **Road Debris**
   - Types: Tire pieces, metal scraps, fallen cargo
   - Size: Various (16x16 to 32x32)
   - Effect: 15% speed reduction + damage
   - Visual: Dark objects on road
   - Spawns: Random locations, higher chance near traffic

3. **Water Puddles** (if raining)
   - Size: 48x24 pixels
   - Effect: 30% steering reduction
   - Visual: Reflective blue surface
   - Spawns: During rain weather events

### Technical Requirements
- Extend Hazard dataclass for dynamic properties
- Add physics modifiers for different hazard types
- Implement traction loss system
- Create visual feedback for hazard effects
- Add hazard spawning algorithm

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Oil slicks cause realistic loss of control
- [x] Debris creates appropriate damage/slowdown
- [x] Visual effects clearly indicate hazard type
- [x] Performance impact < 5% FPS
- [x] Hazards spawn naturally, not frustratingly
- [x] Player can learn to avoid with skill

## Implementation Results
- **Oil Slicks**: 70% steering reduction for 1.5 seconds, spawn behind trucks
- **Debris Types**: Tire chunks, metal scraps, cargo pieces with 15% speed penalty
- **Visual Effects**: Oil has rainbow sheen, debris has irregular shapes
- **Effect System**: Active effect tracking with visual indicators
- **Performance**: Minimal impact with efficient spawning system

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests for physics modifications
- Visual inspection of hazard effects
- Gameplay balance testing
- Performance benchmarking
