## Issue #10: EV Street Restriction System âœ…

### GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Implement EV Street Boundary Enforcement  
**Status**: CLOSED âœ…  
**Labels**: enhancement, phase-3, ev-restriction  
**Milestone**: Traffic System Foundation  

### Current State (From)
- Car could move anywhere on screen (0.0-1.0 coordinates)
- No realistic road boundary enforcement
- Simple crash detection only at extreme edges (0.1/0.9)
- No off-road penalties or effects

### Desired State (To)
- EV restricted to actual road boundaries
- Dynamic road edge calculation based on road geometry
- Off-road penalties including speed reduction and steering resistance
- Visual feedback with road edge markers and warnings
- Realistic correction forces to keep car near road

### Implementation Notes
- âœ… Added dynamic road boundary calculation (`_update_road_boundaries`)
- âœ… Real-time road edge detection based on road center, width, and curves
- âœ… Safety margin accounting for car width (32px each side)
- âœ… Off-road penalty system with time accumulation and speed reduction
- âœ… Steering resistance when off-road (up to 30% reduction)
- âœ… Visual road edge markers (white/red when player approaches)
- âœ… Off-road warning UI with penalty percentage and timer
- âœ… Smooth correction forces to guide car back to road

### Results
- EV now realistically restricted to street boundaries
- Off-road driving penalized with up to 60% speed reduction
- Dynamic road boundaries adjust with curves and width changes
- Visual feedback helps players stay on road
- More realistic and challenging racing experience

## Issue #11: Movement Refinement & Control Optimization âœ…

### GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Refine EV Movement Controls Based on User Feedback  
**Status**: CLOSED âœ…  
**Labels**: enhancement, user-feedback, controls  
**Milestone**: Traffic System Foundation  

### Current State (From)
- Base steering speed: 1.5 * dt (too responsive/extreme)
- Turn influence strength: 0.3 (too strong automatic positioning)
- Steering response rate: 1.2 * dt (too aggressive)
- Curve influence: 0.3 (too strong road curve effect)
- Momentum influence: 0.3 (too much drift effect)

### Desired State (To)
- Base steering speed: 0.5 * dt (tighter manual control)
- Turn influence strength: 0.08 (very subtle automatic positioning)
- Steering response rate: 0.3 * dt (gentler steering response)
- Curve influence: 0.08 (minimal road curve effect)
- Momentum influence: 0.08 (controlled drift effect)

### Implementation Notes
- âœ… Reduced base_steering_speed from 1.5 to 0.5 for tighter manual control
- âœ… Reduced turn_influence_strength from 0.3 to 0.08 for very subtle racing line
- âœ… Reduced steering_response_rate from 1.2 to 0.3 for gentler automatic response
- âœ… Reduced curve_influence from 0.3 to 0.08 for minimal road curve effects
- âœ… Reduced momentum_influence from 0.3 to 0.08 for controlled drift effects

### Results
- EV movement now feels precise and controlled
- Player maintains full manual control while keeping realistic racing physics
- Turn assistance is minimal and doesn't overpower player input
- Momentum and drift effects are present but not overwhelming
- Responsive to user feedback for "tighter" controls

## Issue #12: 4-Lane Traffic System with Directional Flow âœ…

### GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Implement Realistic 4-Lane Highway Traffic System  
**Status**: CLOSED âœ…  
**Labels**: enhancement, phase-3, traffic-system, road-infrastructure  
**Milestone**: Traffic System Foundation  

### Current State (From)
- Simple 3-lane traffic system with random spawning
- No directional awareness - all traffic moving same direction
- Basic lane positions without proper traffic flow
- Road width 200px insufficient for realistic traffic

### Desired State (To)
- Proper 4-lane highway system with bidirectional traffic
- Lane 0: Left lane, player direction
- Lane 1: Right lane, player direction  
- Lane 2: Left lane, oncoming traffic
- Lane 3: Right lane, oncoming traffic
- Doubled road width to 400px for realistic highway scale
- Visual indicators showing traffic direction (headlights vs taillights)

### Implementation Notes
**Traffic System Architecture:**
- âœ… Updated NPCCar dataclass with direction field (-1 for oncoming, 1 for same direction)
- âœ… Implemented proper lane positioning (0.3 for left lanes, 0.7 for right lanes)
- âœ… Added directional spawning logic (70% same direction, 30% oncoming)
- âœ… Updated movement physics for oncoming traffic (combined speed calculation)

**Visual Enhancements:**
- âœ… Enhanced visual representation with headlights/taillights
- âœ… Added center divider line (solid white) to separate traffic directions
- âœ… Added lane divider lines (dashed yellow) for lane change guidance
- âœ… Color-coded traffic (warm colors for same direction, cool colors for oncoming)

**Road Infrastructure:**
- âœ… Doubled road width from 200px to 400px for realistic highway scale
- âœ… Updated all width oscillation values to maintain Â±5% variation
- âœ… Enhanced road markings for 4-lane highway appearance

**Traffic AI Behavior:**
- âœ… Same direction traffic (Lanes 0-1): Spawns ahead/behind player, AI lane changes
- âœ… Oncoming traffic (Lanes 2-3): Spawns far ahead, no lane changes, moves toward player
- âœ… Speed calculations: Same direction uses relative speed, oncoming uses combined speed
- âœ… Lane change safety: Only same-direction traffic changes lanes, with collision avoidance

### Results
- Realistic highway traffic simulation with proper bidirectional flow
- Enhanced immersion with oncoming traffic creating tension
- Larger road provides more space for realistic vehicle movement
- Clear visual separation between traffic directions
- Improved traffic AI that respects lane discipline
- Foundation ready for collision detection and hazard systems
