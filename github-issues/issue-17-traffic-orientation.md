# Issue #17: Fix Oncoming Traffic Visual Orientation

## GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Oncoming traffic cars face wrong direction  
**Status**: CLOSED ✅  
**Labels**: bug, visual, traffic-system  
**Milestone**: Phase 3.2 - Hazard System  

## Problem Description
Oncoming traffic vehicles were visually oriented incorrectly - they appeared to be driving backwards with their headlights pointing away from the player instead of toward the player.

## Current State (From)
- All traffic cars (same direction and oncoming) had headlights at the top
- Oncoming cars appeared to be driving in reverse
- No visual distinction between front and back of vehicles
- Windshields always positioned at top regardless of direction

## Fixed State (To)
- Same-direction traffic: Headlights at top (front), taillights at bottom (rear)
- Oncoming traffic: Headlights at bottom (front facing player), taillights at top
- Windshield position matches vehicle orientation
- Clear visual indication of traffic direction

## Implementation Details
### Visual Changes
- **Same Direction Cars (lanes 3-4)**:
  - White headlights (255, 255, 200) at top
  - Red taillights (200, 0, 0) at bottom
  - Windshield at top third of vehicle
  
- **Oncoming Cars (lanes 1-2)**:
  - White headlights at bottom (larger, size 4)
  - Red taillights at top (smaller, size 2)
  - Windshield at bottom third of vehicle

### Technical Implementation
- Modified `_draw_npc_cars()` method in `src/scenes/drive.py`
- Added proper directional rendering based on `car.direction` field
- Enhanced visual feedback with different light sizes and colors

## Results
✅ Oncoming traffic now correctly faces toward the player
✅ Clear visual distinction between traffic directions
✅ Improved immersion with realistic vehicle orientation
✅ Enhanced safety awareness with proper headlight visibility

## Testing
- Visual inspection confirms correct orientation
- Headlights visible on approaching vehicles
- Taillights visible on vehicles moving away
- No performance impact from rendering changes
