# Issue #18: Scenic Background System

## GitHub Issue Details
**Title**: Add dynamic scenic backgrounds along the highway  
**Status**: CREATED ðŸ“‹  
**Labels**: enhancement, visual, immersion  
**Milestone**: Phase 4.1 - Visual Integration  

## Current State (From)
- Simple sky gradient background
- No variation in scenery
- Highway feels monotonous
- No sense of journey or progression

## Desired State (To)
- Dynamic scenery that changes as you drive
- Multiple scenic types: forest, mountains, city, lake, desert
- Smooth transitions between different areas
- Parallax scrolling for depth
- Enhanced immersion with varied landscapes

## Implementation Plan

### Scenery Types
1. **Forest**
   - Pine trees in background
   - Green color palette
   - Rolling hills

2. **Mountains**
   - Mountain peaks on horizon
   - Snow-capped tops
   - Gray/blue palette

3. **City**
   - Skyscrapers silhouette
   - City lights (if evening)
   - Urban color scheme

4. **Lake**
   - Water on one side
   - Blue reflections
   - Maybe boats in distance

5. **Desert**
   - Cacti and rock formations
   - Orange/brown palette
   - Heat shimmer effect

### Technical Requirements
- Scenery changes every 1000-2000 distance units
- Smooth transitions over 5-10 seconds
- Parallax layers for depth
- Performance-optimized rendering
- Tied to distance traveled

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Add scenery tracking variables
- [ ] Create scenery rendering system
- [ ] Implement parallax background layers
- [ ] Add transition effects
- [ ] Create scenery-specific elements
- [ ] Optimize for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 5 distinct scenery types
- [ ] Smooth transitions between scenes
- [ ] No performance impact (maintain 60 FPS)
- [ ] Enhances immersion significantly
- [ ] Works with existing road curve system
