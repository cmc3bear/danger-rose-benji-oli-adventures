# üîç PIPELINE MONITORING STATUS
## Reformed ClaudeEthos - Active Development Tracking

**Current Status**: MONITORING ACTIVE PIPELINES

## üìä PIPELINE EXECUTION REALITY CHECK

### **Important Clarification**
The parallel agent pipelines represent a **coordination framework and development plan**, not autonomous code execution. Progress on issues requires:

1. **Human Development Work** - Actual coding, testing, asset creation
2. **Evidence Collection** - Screenshots, benchmarks, validation data  
3. **Process Implementation** - Using Reformed ClaudeEthos practices
4. **Coordination Updates** - Reporting progress through the framework

## üéØ PROGRESS TRACKING METHOD

### **How to Update Pipeline Status**:

1. **Complete Development Work** on assigned issues
2. **Collect Evidence** following Reformed ClaudeEthos practices:
   - Screenshot Salvation for visual fixes
   - Performance benchmarks for optimizations  
   - Kid-friendly error testing for UX improvements
   - Commit Confessional format for all changes

3. **Update Coordination Framework**:
   ```bash
   python .claudeethos/agent_coordination_framework.py --status
   ```

4. **Mark Issues Complete** when success criteria are met with evidence
