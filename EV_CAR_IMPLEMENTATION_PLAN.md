# EV Car Selection Implementation Plan for The Drive Minigame

## üéØ Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for adding EV (Electric Vehicle) car selection to The Drive racing minigame in Danger Rose. Players will be able to choose between two distinct car styles before racing, enhancing personalization and gameplay variety.

## üöó Available Car Options

1. **Professional EV** (`ev_professional.png`)
   - Clean, modern electric vehicle design
   - 8-bit pixel art style with smooth lines
   - Electric blue color scheme with cyan accents
   - Appeals to players who prefer sleek aesthetics

2. **Kid's Drawing EV** (`ev_kids_drawing.png`)
   - Charming crayon-style artwork
   - Deliberately imperfect with hand-drawn feel
   - Features smiley face, lightning bolts, and doodles
   - Perfect for younger players or those who enjoy whimsy

- [ ] Verify sprite rendering at all positions
- [ ] Test performance with animated sprites
- [ ] Ensure save/load works correctly

**Milestone 6.2: Gameplay Balance**
- [ ] Balance vehicle stats if different
- [ ] Test with all music tracks
- [ ] Verify child-friendly difficulty
- [ ] Gather family playtesting feedback

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Vehicle Selection Flow
```
Title Screen ‚Üí Character Select ‚Üí Hub World ‚Üí Drive Door ‚Üí Music Selection ‚Üí Vehicle Selection ‚Üí Race
                                                                              ‚Üë
                                                                    [New Addition]
```

### Code Structure

#### 1. Vehicle Selector Component
```python
# src/ui/vehicle_selector.py
class VehicleSelector:
    def __init__(self, screen_width, screen_height, sound_manager):
        self.vehicles = [
            Vehicle("professional", "Professional EV", "ev_professional.png"),
            Vehicle("kids_drawing", "Kid's Drawing", "ev_kids_drawing.png")
        ]
        self.selected_index = 0
```

#### 2. Drive Scene Updates
```python
# src/scenes/drive.py
class DriveGame:
    def __init__(self, scene_manager):
        # Add after music selector
        self.vehicle_selector = VehicleSelector(...)
        self.selected_vehicle = None
        self.car_sprite = None
```

#### 3. Sprite Rendering
```python
def _draw_player_car(self, screen):
    if self.car_sprite:
        # Scale and position sprite
        scaled_sprite = pygame.transform.scale(
            self.car_sprite, 
            (self.car_width, self.car_height)
        )
        car_rect = scaled_sprite.get_rect(center=(self.player_x, self.player_y))
        screen.blit(scaled_sprite, car_rect)
```

### Data Persistence
```json
{
  "selected_character": "Danger",
  "selected_vehicle": "professional",  // New field
  "high_scores": {...}
}
```
