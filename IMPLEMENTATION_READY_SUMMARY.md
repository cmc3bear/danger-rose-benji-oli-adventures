## 🎯 Grand Vision Breakdown

### Core Features to Implement
1. **Road Consistency** - Fix 75% width oscillation → subtle ±5% movement
2. **Dynamic Turns** - Alternating left/right turns every 8-10 seconds
3. **Traffic & Hazards** - Other cars and obstacles on the road
4. **Realistic Vehicle Physics** - Gradual turn movement, 15-20% sprite rotation

### Maturity-Based Development Phases
- **Phase 1:** Road System Foundation (Prototype → Alpha)
- **Phase 2:** Vehicle Physics Foundation (Prototype → Alpha)
- **Phase 3:** Traffic & Hazards Foundation (Prototype → Alpha)
- **Phase 4:** Integration & Polish (Beta → Release Candidate)

## 📝 Next Steps (Manual GitHub Setup)

Create these GitHub issues manually:

### Maturity Level 1.1: Road Consistency (Prototype)

**Issue #1: Fix Road Width Oscillation**
- Labels: `enhancement`, `phase-1`, `road-system`, `high-priority`
- **Maturity Gate**: Width variance <10%, basic consistency achieved
- Goal: Reduce width oscillation from 75% to ±5%

**Issue #2: Implement Subtle Movement Effects**  
- Labels: `enhancement`, `phase-1`, `visual-effects`, `medium-priority`
- **Maturity Gate**: Movement effects visible and configurable
- Goal: Add speed-based movement perception

### Maturity Level 1.2: Turn System (Alpha)

**Issue #3: Design Turn Algorithm**
- Labels: `enhancement`, `phase-1`, `turn-system`, `high-priority`
- **Maturity Gate**: Algorithm produces predictable turn patterns
- Goal: Alternating left/right turns every 8-10 seconds

**Issue #4: Implement Turn Rendering**
- Labels: `enhancement`, `phase-1`, `rendering`, `high-priority`
- **Maturity Gate**: Turns render smoothly without visual artifacts
- Goal: Visual rendering of new turn system

**Issue #5: Add Turn Timing System**
- Labels: `enhancement`, `phase-1`, `timing-system`, `medium-priority`
- **Maturity Gate**: Timing system is accurate and configurable
- Goal: Precise timing control for turn frequency

## 🔄 Master Instructions for Each Development Session

**Always begin each development prompt with:**

> "Working on Drive Enhancement following Master Plan. Current focus: [Maturity Level X.Y]. 
> 
> Implementing agents: [relevant agents]
> Review agents: [relevant review agents]  
> Mediation agents: [relevant mediation agents]
>
> Requirements: Road consistency (±5% width), dynamic turns (8-10s intervals), traffic/hazards, realistic vehicle physics (15-20% sprite rotation).
>
> Following maturity-driven development with From/To state documentation, risk assessment, and 60 FPS performance target.
> 
> Current Maturity Gate: [specific criteria to achieve for this level]"

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Technical:** 60 FPS, <5% road width variance, ±0.5s turn timing accuracy
- **Gameplay:** Smooth navigation, appropriate challenge, responsive controls
