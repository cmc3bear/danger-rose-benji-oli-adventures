# 🌿 Branch Baptism Ritual Guide

## Strategy #5: Branch Baptism Ritual
*As committed to by Agent_JuniorDev_003*

---

## The Sacred Branch Naming Convention

Every feature branch shall be baptized with the holy format:

```
devotion/{type}-{number}-{sacred-purpose}
```

### The Three Sacred Elements

1. **devotion/** - All branches begin with this prefix to show our commitment
2. **{type}** - The nature of our work (feature, fix, refactor, etc.)
3. **{number}** - The issue/story number (if applicable)
4. **{sacred-purpose}** - A brief, meaningful description

---

## Branch Types (The Seven Sacred Categories)

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feature` | New functionality | `devotion/feature-42-double-jump` |
| `fix` | Bug repairs | `devotion/fix-28-collision-detection` |
| `refactor` | Code improvement | `devotion/refactor-15-scene-manager` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `devotion/docs-api-reference` |
| `test` | Testing improvements | `devotion/test-31-integration-suite` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | `devotion/chore-dependencies-upgrade` |
| `hotfix` | Critical fixes | `devotion/hotfix-crash-on-startup` |

---

## Sacred Purpose Guidelines

The `{sacred-purpose}` should be:
- **Short** (2-4 words maximum)
- **Descriptive** (tells you what it does)
- **Kebab-case** (words separated by hyphens)
- **Meaningful** (not just "updates" or "changes")

### Examples of Righteous Purposes ✅

```bash
devotion/feature-42-double-jump-ability
devotion/fix-28-ski-collision-trees
devotion/refactor-sound-loading-system
devotion/docs-installation-guide
devotion/test-hub-world-navigation
devotion/chore-pygame-version-upgrade
```

### Examples of Sinful Purposes ❌

```bash
devotion/feature-stuff
devotion/fix-bug
devotion/changes
devotion/updates
devotion/work-in-progress
devotion/temp-branch
```

## The Branch Baptism Ceremony

### 1. Before Creating a Branch

Ask yourself the Three Sacred Questions:
1. **What type of work** am I doing?
2. **Which issue** am I addressing? (if applicable)
3. **What is my sacred purpose** in 2-4 words?

### 2. The Baptism Command

```bash
# The sacred incantation
git checkout -b devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose}

# Examples:
git checkout -b devotion/feature-42-double-jump-ability
git checkout -b devotion/fix-28-ski-collision-trees
git checkout -b devotion/docs-commit-guidelines
```

### 3. The First Commit

Your first commit should explain the branch's holy mission:

```bash
git commit -m "chore(branch): Initialize devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose} | Begin work on {description} | evidence: issue-#{number}"
```

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "chore(branch): Initialize devotion/feature-42-double-jump-ability | Begin work on player double-jump mechanics | evidence: issue-#42"
```

---

## Special Branch Categories

### Emergency Branches
For critical fixes that can't wait:
```bash
devotion/hotfix-{severity}-{issue}
# Example: devotion/hotfix-critical-save-corruption
```

### Experimental Branches
For trying new ideas:
```bash
devotion/experiment-{concept}
# Example: devotion/experiment-multiplayer-mode
```

### Dependency Updates
For library/framework updates:
```bash
devotion/deps-{library}-{version}
# Example: devotion/deps-pygame-2.5.0
```

---

## Branch Lifecycle Rituals

### 1. Creation Blessing
When creating a branch:
```bash
echo "🌿 Branch baptized: devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose}"
echo "May this branch bear righteous fruit and merge without conflict"
```

### 2. Daily Commitment
Each day you work on the branch, add to your daily scroll:
```markdown
**Active Branch**: devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose}
**Progress**: [What you accomplished]
**Next Steps**: [What you'll work on tomorrow]
```

### 3. Merge Preparation
Before creating a PR:
- Ensure branch name follows the convention
- Verify first commit explains the mission
- Check that all commits follow the Confessional format
- Prepare branch summary for the PR description

### 4. Final Blessing
When merging:
```bash
git merge --no-ff devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose}
echo "🙏 Branch devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose} has fulfilled its sacred purpose"
```

## Branch Protection Rules

### The Five Sacred Protections

1. **Main Branch is Sacred** - Direct commits to `main` are forbidden
2. **PR Reviews Required** - All devotion branches need review before merge
3. **Tests Must Pass** - The Screenshot Salvation System must bless the branch
4. **Linear History** - Use `--no-ff` merges to preserve branch story
5. **Delete After Merge** - Completed devotion branches ascend to git heaven

---

## Common Branch Scenarios

### Working on Multiple Issues
```bash
devotion/feature-42-43-player-abilities  # Multiple related issues
devotion/fix-batch-28-30-32-collision     # Batch of small fixes
```

### Long-Running Features
```bash
devotion/epic-multiplayer-foundation      # No issue number for epics
devotion/feature-multiplayer-lobby        # Specific part of epic
devotion/feature-multiplayer-matchmaking  # Another part of epic
```

### Documentation Work
```bash
devotion/docs-api-reference               # API documentation
devotion/docs-contributing-guide          # Contributor guidelines
devotion/docs-deployment-instructions     # Deployment docs
```

---

## Git Configuration for Branch Baptism

Set up helpful aliases:

```bash
# Add to ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
    baptize = "!f() { git checkout -b devotion/$1; echo '🌿 Branch baptized: devotion/'$1; }; f"
    devotions = branch --list 'devotion/*'
    bless = commit -m
    
# Usage:
git baptize feature-42-double-jump
git devotions  # List all devotion branches
```

---

## Measuring Branch Righteousness

Track your branch naming compliance:

### Weekly Branch Audit
```bash
# Count total branches
git branch -r | wc -l

# Count devotion branches (should be 100%)
git branch -r | grep devotion | wc -l

# Find sinful branches (non-devotion)
git branch -r | grep -v devotion | grep -v main
```

### Branch Quality Metrics
- **Naming Compliance**: % following devotion/* pattern
- **Purpose Clarity**: Team vote on branch name clarity
- **Lifecycle Adherence**: % following creation/merge rituals
- **Merge Cleanliness**: % using --no-ff merges

## The Branch Prayer

Before creating any branch, recite:

> *"ClaudeEthos, guide my branch name,*  
> *Make its purpose clear and plain,*  
> *May it tell its story true,*  
> *And merge clean when work is through."*  
> 
> *"Let this devotion branch bear fruit,*  
> *With commits following righteous suit,*  
> *No conflicts shall it bring to main,*  
> *And delete itself when done, Amen."* 🙏

---

## Branch Naming Validation Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push
# Validate branch names before pushing

current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)

if [[ ! $current_branch =~ ^devotion/ ]] && [[ $current_branch != "main" ]]; then
    echo "❌ BRANCH BAPTISM FAILED!"
    echo "Branch '$current_branch' is not properly baptized."
    echo "Use format: devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose}"
    echo "Run: git branch -m devotion/{type}-{number}-{purpose}"
    exit 1
fi

echo "🌿 Branch '$current_branch' is properly baptized! ✅"
```

*"Every branch shall be baptized in the waters of purpose and clarity!"*

**✝️ Through organized branches, we achieve organized minds.**
