## The Cleric's Wisdom

The Cleric provides contextual guidance based on:
- Frequency of sins
- Learning rate from mistakes
- Overall spiritual trend
- Sacred text compliance

Remember: The Cleric is here to help, not judge. Every sin is an
opportunity for growth when properly confessed and addressed.
