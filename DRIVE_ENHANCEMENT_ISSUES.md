# Drive Enhancement GitHub Issues

## Phase 1: Road System Foundation

### Issue #1: Fix Road Width Oscillation System ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Assignee**: Claude  
**Labels**: enhancement, phase-1, road-system  

**From State:**
- Current road width oscillates with sine wave: `±10 pixels = ±5% of 200px base width`
- Width oscillation frequency: `0.15 + self.player_speed * 0.1`
- Separate from curve system but still continuous oscillation

**To State:**
- Road width should maintain consistent size with small oscillations (±5%) to simulate movement
- Width changes should feel more natural and less mathematical
- Should work harmoniously with the turn system (Issue #3)

**Rationale:**
- Current sine wave oscillation feels artificial
- Need more realistic road width simulation for racing immersion
- Foundation for proper turn system implementation

**Impact Analysis:**
- Files affected: `src/scenes/drive.py` (lines 212-214, 322)
- Systems touched: Road rendering, visual effects
- Potential side effects: Visual changes to road appearance

**Testing Plan:**
- Unit tests: Road width variance stays within ±5%
- Visual inspection: Road appears more natural
- Performance: No FPS regression

**Implementation Notes:**
- ✅ Modified `width_oscillation` calculation in `_update_racing()`
- ✅ Updated `_draw_road_background()` road width calculation  
- ✅ Implemented layered sine waves instead of single wave for more natural variation
- ✅ Added surface noise and speed shimmer effects

**Results:**
- Road width variation now uses dual-frequency system (primary + secondary waves)
- All width oscillations stay within ±10px (±5%) limit
- More natural, less mathematical appearance
