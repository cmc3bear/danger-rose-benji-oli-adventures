# The Drive Enhancement Master Plan

## üéØ Vision Statement
Transform The Drive minigame into a polished racing experience with realistic road behavior, dynamic turns, traffic/hazards, and responsive vehicle controls.

## üìã Master Instructions (To be maintained at beginning of each prompt)

### Core Requirements AS FEATURES COMPLETE CHECK MARK THEM
1. ‚úÖ **Road Consistency**: Road width should maintain consistent size with small oscillations (¬±5%) to simulate movement
2. ‚úÖ **Dynamic Turns**: Implement alternating left/right turns every 8-10 seconds of straight road
3. ‚úÖ **Traffic & Hazards**: Add other cars and obstacles on the road (4-lane directional traffic implemented)
4. ‚úÖ **Vehicle Physics**: 
   - Car moves toward turn direction gradually
   - Sprite rotates 15-20% during turns
   - Realistic deceleration in turns

### Development Methodology
- **Issue-Driven Development**: Each feature as a GitHub issue
- **Milestone-Based Approach**: Grouped features with testing points
- **Change Documentation**: From/To conditions with rationale
- **Triple Agent Review System**:
  - Implementation Agents (specialized skills)
  - Critical Review Agents (risk assessment)
  - Mediation Agents (final approval, expert in field)
