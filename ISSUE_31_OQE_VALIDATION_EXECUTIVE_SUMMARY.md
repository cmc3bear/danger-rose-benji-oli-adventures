## ðŸ§ª Testing Methodology

### Automated Simulation Framework
The validation used a sophisticated automated testing approach that simulates real gameplay conditions:

**Baseline Testing (AI Disabled)**
- 120 seconds of standard traffic behavior simulation
- 7,200 frames processed at 60 FPS
- Establishes performance and behavior baselines

**AI-Enhanced Testing (Full System)**
- 120 seconds with intelligent traffic passing logic active
- Multiple driver personality types (Aggressive, Normal, Cautious)
- Real-time performance monitoring and metrics collection

### Evidence Collection
- **TrafficSimulationFramework**: Provides OQE-compliant metrics collection
- **Real-time Monitoring**: FPS, memory usage, and scan times tracked per frame
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Lane changes, emergency evasions, and conflicts logged
- **Comparative Analysis**: Direct baseline vs AI-enabled performance comparison
